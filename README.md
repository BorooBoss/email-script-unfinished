# Email Script For Sending Messages To Multiple Receivers At Once
Small script working with json data file. The idea was to avoid seeing other receivers when emails were sent to multiple accounts in one press. It works like 
blind copy feature but without it looking like it is blind copy. Every email will be send separately. Email addresses can be easily but into json and after main function is called, 
emails will be sent.

**Here is the current scheme**
